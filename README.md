## Set up Environmental Variables
This project requires you to set up some environmental variables to allow you connect to your Cloud storage provider. The approach recommended for this project, is for you to create a `.env` file within the root project directory. An example has been set for you in the `.env.example` file. Please have a look at it and repalce the environmental variables in your newly created `.env` file.
